# What is Belli-Zard.filter?

Belli-Zard is a very clean and simple item filter made for Path of Diablo's Perlite version (patch 20) with the intention to prevent lagging due to filter size/bloat.  The interface has mostly kept very close to vanilla diablo with efforts made to clear clutter and prevent item stacking while providing ample drop imformation to the user.  It is loosely based on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofdiablo/comments/g33v35/kryszards_loot_filter_completly_new_one/">Kryszard's Loot Filter</a> last updated for the previous patch version (P19-Zincite).  

This loot filter is now updated with the necessary changes to allow for notification of items and location information.  Additionally, it contains a few changes for items found desirable in this patch and a couple of missing items added as well.  I've also removed all formatting on charms since it just seemed to clutter the interface.

I've also recently added text to various items to include information such as crafting (on the item), socketing (on pgems), and upgrading recipes (on pgems), possible corruption mods and a warning (on rares, sets, and uniques) if the item should be upgraded prior to corrution.

If you have comments or requests, please feel free to post an issue here or find me on Discord.
