# What is Belli-Zard.filter?

Belli-Zard is an item filter made for Path of Diablo's Perlite version (patch 20).  It is based on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofdiablo/comments/g33v35/kryszards_loot_filter_completly_new_one/">Kryszard's Loot Filter</a> last updated for the previous patch version (P19-Zincite).  

This loot filter is now updated with the necessary changes to allow for notification of items and location information.  Additionally, it contains a few changes for items found desirable in this patch and a couple of missing items added as well.  

If you have comments or requests, please feel free to post an issue here or find me on Discord.
